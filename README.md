# Spiderclam website

I went full pleb and used sveltekit (static) and tailwind. It was mildly enjoyable.

Bye.

## Structure

- `npm run gen:post 'post title here'` to scaffold a post (boilerplate)
- Blog content goes in `content/blog`. Directory name equals slug. index.svx must exist.
- That's it for now.

## Post ideas

- Explain midi parsing (in the browser) by example
- Explain this very blog and how to make your own
- Add artstation stuff

## Todo

- Add latest "gallery" entries to landing page
- srcset for images
- Add 404 page
- Add "see all" button to home for latest blog posts
  - Add og tags for blog (read time etc)
- Add og tags for gallery (image, primarily.)
- Pagination for blog posts and gallery
- Move to spaces.
- Add "back" button to blog posts and gallery
- SEO (see what's missing)
- Add education to about page
- [RSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sveltekit-rss)
- [Search](https://www.algolia.com/doc/tools/crawler/netlify-plugin/quick-start/)
- [analytics](https://piwik.pro/pricing/)
- Series (multiple parts, single project). Maybe not as a part of "blog" but as a part of a new tutorials section?
