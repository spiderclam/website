Software and design for mobile, web and beyond. With SpoonX Studio I've had the opportunity to work on a diverse set of projects. 
MVPs, mobile apps, dashboards, APIs and video streaming services just to name a few. Some of the more notable projects I've worked on have their own entries in this list.
I've also designed and built [this beautiful website](https://spiderclam.dev/) as my new personal website as well as [this website](https://spoonx.studio/) for my company.
