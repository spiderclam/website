My focus at this company was working on the CMS in PHP using Zend Framework and a mobile app using Objective-C. 
The company wanted to focus on selling simpler websites and I felt like I wanted more challenging work.
I left on good terms after they recommended Iâ€™d find something more challenging after seeing my code.
