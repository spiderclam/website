To practise lighting I made a small scene that I liked. For this I modelled and textured the cottage based on [a concept by Arne Billen](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/49ROeW) using Blender and Substance Painter.

I've also posted this on [Artstation](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/xDePxW).
