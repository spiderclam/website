description: First blogpost of the rest of your life.

This is the first blog post of the rest of your life. And mine. And blogs.

Who cares, this is a placeholder. I'm just writing this to have something on here. Why?
Because an empty website looks silly. So for that reason I'll just showcase some features and write a bunch of text.

## Code

Next up, here's a `code block` to show that it has line numbers and line highlighting:

```ts {5}
import { some } from 'code';

class JustToTest {
	syntaxHighlighting(nowThatIAmUsing = 'scss') {
		return 'For global and dynamic styles' === 'compare me to the deathbringer';
	}
}
```

## Beep-boop. Ramblings

Actually, why should I write this myself? We have robots now. I'll ask ChatGPT to write a bit.

**Ten minutes later...**

Alright, that took longer than expected. ChatGPT went a bit negative when asked to rant. But we got it sorted.
I present to you, the lengthy and positive ramblings of a machine!
